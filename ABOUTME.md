- 👋 Hi, I’m @DemyanCherekhovich. Worked as a management consultant for 8 year at KPMG. Specialized in budgeting, business planning, BI and similar business related topics.
- 👀 I’m interested in python for corporate finance. Ways to create elaborate yet simple FP&A models for better decision making. As a byproduct I am following advents in LP libraries etc.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, LP and MTI. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creating better FP&A solutions. The closest thing that came to a good product is definitely PyPlan, but it is still far from user-friendliness needed to share results with business managers.
- 📫 If you want to discuss some interesting project where I might be of help feel free to text me on whatsapp +995574031841
